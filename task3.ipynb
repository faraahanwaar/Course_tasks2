    "BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is the software that a computer's microprocessor uses to start up a computer system after it's turned on. It also manages the flow of data between a computer's operating system (OS) and devices connected to it, such as a hard drive, video adapter, keyboard, mouse, and printer.\n",
    "We use BIOS to:\n",
    "Load the operating system into memory ,\n",
    "  Manage the flow of data between the operating system and peripheral devices ,\n",
    "  Provide a set of low-level routines that the operating system uses to interact with different devices ,\n",
    "  Password protect the boot process, which means that you must enter a password before any BIOS activity occurs ,\n",
    "  Manage a range of settings for hard disks, clock, etc.\n"
